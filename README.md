Cell competition is a core biological concept that plays a role in several cellular mechanisms. Previous studies defined and characterized two types of binary competitions using a computational framework, a hybrid Cellular Potts Model enriched with Cellular Automata rules. Their analysis revealed that *biochemical competition* is governed by tissue organization, while the outcome of the *mechanical competition* is mainly determined by the homeostatic density of the two populations. In this project, we study the impact of introducing a third cell type in the system and whether these cells can change the outcome of the competition, investigating the role of several parameters. Our work suggests that mechanical competition is extremely robust, with the third cells having no impact on the fate of the losers. On the other hand, losers can be protected by the third cells during the biochemical competition. A better understanding of cell competition can significantly improve our characterization of biological self-regulation, with impact spacing from patterning to cancer evolution.
